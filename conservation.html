      What hurts banana ducks?
    </h2>
    <p> The biggest issues that hurt banana ducks are destruction of habitats, particularly deforestation. Increased deforestation means that the banana ducks lose their home in the forest. This forces them to relocate, resulting in banana ducks inhabiting more dangerous, urban areas, or living in forested areas where other banana ducks already live, and the greater competition means fewwer banana ducks survive. </p>
