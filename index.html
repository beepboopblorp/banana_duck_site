      What is a Banana Duck?
    </h2>
    <p> Banana ducks are a species of duck known for their unique appearance. Their name is due to their distinct banana-shaped look. Some banana ducks are also referred to as 'babanas' or 'babana ducks' when they are young. </p>
    <h2>
      Where can you find Banana Ducks?
    </h2>
    <p> Banana ducks are often found in forested areas, regardless of whether the forest is temperate or tropical. Sometimes they can also be found in urban areas, but only if these areas are nearby to a forest. The map below shows the documented locations of banana ducks with green dots.</p>

      What is The *Official* Banana Duck Conservation Website all about?
    </h2>
    <p> Over the past 100 years, banana ducks have significantly decreased in population and are officially endangered. The *Official* Banana Duck Conservation Website hopes to provide information that encourages the public to help conserve the ducks and their habitats! Our goal is not only to keep a steady population of banana ducks throughout the world, but to even help their population grow!</p>
